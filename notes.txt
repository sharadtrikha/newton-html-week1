How flipkart.com works ?
We talked on 2 characters - client and server
Client - browser (google chrome)
Server - is the person who is serving requests for client


what Kind of things client needs ?
Html, css and js files

How can fulfil these requests ?
SERVER 

--------------------------------------
HOW INTERNET WORKS !!!!!!!!!!!

Client and Server

How client and server interact with each other ?

How do machines/laptops/pcs can be identified ? (unique identifier)
IP ADDRESS (each machine has its own unique ip address)

In order to talk to any machine ?
I need to know its ip address


flipkart.com ->  DNS (domain name system) -> 195.545.3.2 

Introduce 2 more characters :

1. TCP
2. HTTP

In order to connect client and server :
we make TCP (Transmission control protocol) - 3 way handshake connection between them (Computer Networking)

Assume these 2 entities connected over TCP.
Now, they will start REQUEST-RESPONSE cycle.

In order for REQUEST-RESPONSE cycle to happen -> we need Protocol ->
We use HTTP protocol
------------------------------------------
